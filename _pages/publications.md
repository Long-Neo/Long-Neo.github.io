**[1] Does Numerical Information Matter for Predicting Default Rates? Evidence from a P2P Lending Platform**, 2021 <br>

**Abstract:** Using 2012 to 2014 data from the Lending Club, this paper investigates the impact of numerical information in descriptive texts on the ex post default rate in online P2P lending. We find that borrowers providing numerical information with higher density are less likely to default. However, this predictive power is weakened if more round numbers are included in numerical information. In addition, numerical information can enhance the predictive power of traditional indicators like FICO, annual income, and DTI on default rate. Finally, using big data algorithms, we verify that such numerical information can provide additional value in predicting defaults.
